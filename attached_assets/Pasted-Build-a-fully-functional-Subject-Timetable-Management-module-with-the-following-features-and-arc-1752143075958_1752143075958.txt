Build a fully functional "Subject & Timetable Management" module with the following features and architecture:

---

### 🔷 SECTION: Subject Management
- Allow admin to **add subjects** per year.
- Subject structure:
  - Course Type (PUC / Post PUC)
  - Stream (Commerce / Science)
  - Year (1st PU to 7th Year)
  - Section (Only for PUC Commerce A/B)
- Store subjects in database with metadata:
  - subjectID, subjectName, stream, year, section (if applicable)
- Sync subjects with timetable builder.

---

### 🔷 SECTION: Timetable Builder
- Weekly timetable grid (**Monday to Sunday**)
- **Friday must be disabled (Leave day)** – no periods allowed
- Dynamically generate rows based on **max allowed periods**:
  - 1st & 2nd PUC: 3 periods/day
  - 3rd–5th Year: 7 periods/day
  - 6th & 7th Year: 8 periods/day
- Allow setting:
  - Subject per period
  - Period Name
  - Period Start/End Time
- Validations:
  - No time overlaps
  - No duplicate subjects in a single day unless allowed
- Save weekly grid per class (based on Course, Year, Stream, Section if applicable)

---

### 🔄 Sync Logic with Attendance
- When Take Attendance is opened:
  - Fetch current day timetable
  - Auto-fill period structure
- Sync with:
  - ✅ Take Attendance
  - 📊 Attendance Sheet
  - 🕒 Missed Attendance
  - 📅 History
- Use real-time fetch based on:
  - Date
  - Class metadata
  - Get mapped periods from timetable builder

---

### ⚙️ BACKEND (Firebase / Replit DB)
- `/subjects`: Store all subjects with courseType/year/stream/section
- `/timetables`: Class-wise timetable with periods per day
- `/attendance`: Sync periods to reflect timetable config
- Auto-generate default template if timetable not found for class

---

### 🧠 ADDITIONAL FEATURE IDEAS
- 🔄 Duplicate timetable across sections/years
- ⏰ Bulk edit timings
- 📅 Holiday-aware schedule skipping (with Friday as default weekly holiday)
- 🧾 Export timetable per class

---

### 🔗 UI Navigation Fix
- Fix "Click to open →" for both Subject Management & Timetable Builder
  - Route them to respective functional pages
  - If blank, ensure correct routing setup & fetch logic

---

### 📝 Example:
For 3rd Year Post PUC:
- Subject list: Arabic, Tafseer, Fiqh, Hadith, etc.
- Timetable: 7 periods per day
- Friday will show "No Classes"
- Attendance auto-generates per class based on schedule
