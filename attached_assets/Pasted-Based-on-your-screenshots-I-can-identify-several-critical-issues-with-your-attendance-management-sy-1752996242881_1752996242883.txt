Based on your screenshots, I can identify several critical issues with your attendance management system. Here are the problems and their solutions:
Issues Identified:
1. Student Data Not Loading in Take Attendance (1st PU Science)

The take attendance screen shows blurred/placeholder student data instead of actual names
This suggests a data loading or permission issue

2. Period Selection Not Syncing with Timetable

Periods shown in dropdown don't match the actual timetable configuration
System shows generic "Period 1, Period 2, Period 3" instead of subject-specific periods

3. Cross-Section Attendance Lock Issue

Attendance locked for Commerce Section A is incorrectly affecting Science section
This indicates improper session/state management

4. Incorrect Student List in Attendance Sheet

Attendance sheet showing students from multiple sections instead of selected section only
Shows 4 students total but mixing different sections

Solutions:
Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. Fix Student Data Loading
Check:
- Database connection for 1st PU Science section
- Student enrollment status in that section
- User permissions for accessing Science section data
- API endpoints returning correct student lists
2. Correct Period-Timetable Integration
Issues to resolve:
- Link period dropdown to actual timetable subjects
- Ensure period selection reflects subject names, not just numbers
- Verify timetable is properly assigned to each section
3. Fix Session/Lock Management
Problems:
- Attendance locks should be section-specific, not global
- Clear existing locks before starting new section attendance
- Implement proper session isolation between sections
4. Filter Students by Selected Section
Current issue: Showing all students regardless of section selection
Fix needed: Apply proper filtering based on:
- Course Type (PU College)
- Year (1st PU)
- Division (Science)
- Section (A)
Debugging Steps:

Clear All Cached Data

Log out and log back in
Clear browser cache
Reset any active attendance sessions


Verify Database Relationships

Check if students are properly linked to sections
Verify timetable assignments per section
Confirm attendance table relationships


Test Section Isolation

Try accessing each section separately
Verify data doesn't leak between sections
Test attendance locking per section



Quick Test Protocol:

Select "1st PU Science" → Check if student names appear correctly
Verify period dropdown shows actual subjects from timetable
Confirm attendance sheet shows only Science section students
Test that locks don't affect other sections
