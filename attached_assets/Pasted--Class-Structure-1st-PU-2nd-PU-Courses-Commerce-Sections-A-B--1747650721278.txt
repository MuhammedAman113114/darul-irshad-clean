    - Dropdown:
        - Options: "Lecture", "Note"
        - Used to categorize attendance type

2. Mode Toggle (Active/Inactive):
    - If "Active":
        - Show student list with Present/Absent toggles
        - Attendance is saved and counted
    - If "Inactive":
        - Hide student list
        - Display note: "Attendance not active. Enable to mark attendance."
        - Future attendance can still be taken by re-activating

✅ Attendance Logic:

- Student States:
    - ✅ Present
    - ❌ Absent (Default)
    - 🟡 On Leave → Shown as a tag but still treated as Absent

- Only two actionable options: Present or Absent
- If student is on official leave:
    - Display yellow "On Leave" tag beside name
    - Counted under Absent in summary

📅 Period Structure:

- 1st & 2nd PU:
    - Fixed 3 periods per day

- 3rd–5th Year:
    - Default: 7 periods/day
    - Add/Delete period allowed

- 6th–7th Year:
    - 7 periods/day
    - Period name & time can be edited

🧠 Smart Behavior:

- Auto-switch view depending on selected year/course/section
- Student list updates dynamically
- Prevent marking attendance multiple times for same period
    - Once saved, period becomes read-only unless reopened
- Auto-save to local if offline; sync later

🧩 Student List UI:
- List item format:
    ```
    👤 [Student Name]   [✅ Present] [❌ Absent]   (🟡 On Leave tag if applicable)
    ```
- Optional search bar for quick filtering
- Summary at bottom:
    ```
    ✅ Present: [count]   ❌ Absent: [count]
    ```

🔘 Footer Actions:
- [💾 Save Attendance]
- [🧼 Clear All] (optional)

🔄 Future-Proof:
- Attendance can be toggled from inactive → active later
