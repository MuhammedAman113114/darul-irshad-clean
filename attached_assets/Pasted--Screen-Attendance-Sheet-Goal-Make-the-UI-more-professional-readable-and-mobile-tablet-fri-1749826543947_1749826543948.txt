📐 Screen: Attendance Sheet
🎯 Goal: Make the UI more professional, readable, and mobile/tablet friendly

🔁 REPLIT UI/UX IMPROVEMENT PROMPT

🧼 General Improvements:
- Reduce horizontal scroll: Group days under week headers (Week 1, Week 2...)
- Fix row height and cell alignment
- Add vertical and horizontal scrollbars with clear visibility
- Freeze header row + student name column on scroll

🔎 Top Filter Bar (Redesign):
| [Month & Year 📅] | [Period ⬇️] | [Search Student 🔍] | [Export Excel ⬇️] |
- Use responsive 2-column layout for mobile view
- Add a subtle card background and padding to the filter section

📊 Table Redesign:
- Row 1 (Header):
  Week 1      | Week 2      | ...
  Sun | Mon | Tue | ... (inside each week)

- Columns:
  | # | Student Name | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | ... | Total Summary |
  - Inside each week: 7 small day-cells with compact status icons

📌 Cell Marking (Icons/Colors):
- ✅ Present: Green dot/icon
- ❌ Absent: Red X
- 🚫 Leave: Yellow dot
- 🛑 Holiday: Gray slash
- Empty: Dash “–” (for non-marked days)

🧾 Row Design:
- Student Name: Bold
- Roll No: small subtitle below name
- Total Summary: Show total P / A / L as chips at row-end

📥 Export Button:
- Style as prominent button
- Dropdown next to it with options:
  • Export Current View
  • Export Full Month
  • Export by Period

📱 Responsive Behavior:
- On mobile:
  → Student rows become vertical cards
  → Each week collapses into a horizontal scroll inside the card
  → Export button moves to bottom fixed bar

🧩 Sync Logic (Do NOT remove):
- Data comes from “Take Attendance” tab
- Save to Firebase + localStorage
- Sync on reconnect
- Show loading spinner if sync in progress

🧠 Optional Enhancements:
- Hover/click on any cell shows:
  "Present | 9:00–10:00 | Taken by: Teacher X"
- Tap to open modal for per-day breakdown

📚 Legend Redesign:
- Use color-coded chips with icons
- Place it fixed at bottom-right corner with expand/collapse option

✅ RESULT:
- Full-month calendar-style table, responsive and readable
- Quick export, synced data
- No feature regression from previous version
- Fits seamlessly into current design system
