Great — you're building a full-featured Madrasa Student Management App for mobile (React Native). Since you're targeting mobile usability for teachers and principals, here's a clean and efficient app design plan, broken down into:

✅ 1. Design Principles for Mobile
Principle	Why It Matters
📱 Minimal Taps	Teachers shouldn’t dig deep to find a batch or period
🧭 Role-based Navigation	Principal vs Teacher — different access
🧩 Modular Screens	Each feature should be its own screen (Attendance, Results, Namaz, etc.)
🕹️ Fast Interactions	One-tap attendance toggles, bulk actions, floating buttons
📊 Quick Overviews	Show attendance %, remark counts, etc., as badges/cards
☁️ Offline Sync (Optional)	Useful in low-connectivity areas using local storage + sync later
