📘 REAL-TIME ATTENDANCE MODULE LOGIC – TEXT PROMPT

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Ensure all attendance-related modules (Management, History, Trend, Missed) rely strictly on real attendance data—no demo, placeholder, or assumed data allowed.

---

✅ MODULES COVERED:
1. Attendance Management
2. Attendance History
3. Attendance Trends
4. Missed Classes Tracker

---

📌 CORE RULES:
- Use only actual attendance records stored after marking.
- Do not generate or simulate data if attendance was never marked.
- Students on approved leave or emergency leave must be excluded from "Missed Classes" calculations.
- Real-time synchronization must be maintained across all modules.

---

📂 DATA DEPENDENCY:
- Source student attendance only from verified storage (e.g., localStorage keys or actual database entries).
- All visual components (charts, tables, stats) must reflect this real data.
- Never auto-fill or assume present/absent status for unrecorded days.

---

❗ MISSED CLASS LOGIC:
- A class is considered missed **only if**:
  - Attendance was marked for the period
  - Student was marked as "Absent"
- A class is **not considered missed** if:
  - Student was on approved leave or emergency leave
  - Attendance for that date/period was never marked

---

📊 TRENDS & HISTORY:
- All reports and analytics must calculate from actual attendance logs.
- Monthly and weekly trends should exclude periods without attendance records.
- Attendance percentage = Total Present ÷ Total Periods Taken (not total possible)

---

🔄 REAL-TIME SYNC:
- Any attendance update must auto-refresh all dependent modules:
  - Update trends
  - Update missed class summaries
  - Update student profiles

---

🧩 USER INTERFACE RULE:
- Do not show dummy students or classes
- If attendance is not marked for a day, show “No data available” instead of assuming anything
- Missed section must clearly show date, period, subject, and reason ("Absent without leave")

---

🎯 OUTCOME:
- 100% real data usage
- No artificial inflations
- Accurate missed tracking
- Honest trend insights
