 Replit AI Prompt — Madrasa Student Management App (Teacher + Principal Only)
You are a React Native + Firebase developer. Build a Madrasa-focused student management app strictly for Teachers and Principals. No student access is required. The app must follow the structure and features below:

🏫 1. Course Structure & Batches
PU College (1st & 2nd Year):

Commerce:

1st PU: Batches A, B (customizable).

2nd PU: Batches A, B (customizable).

Science:

1st PU: Single fixed batch.

2nd PU: Single fixed batch (new requirement).

Post-PUC Courses:

Year-wise structure:

3rd–5th Year: Single batch, 7 default periods.

6th–7th Year: Single batch, 8 default periods.

✏️ 2. Batch Customization
PU Commerce: Add/remove batches (e.g., Batch C).

PU Science: Fixed single batch only.

Custom section names allowed (e.g., "Morning Batch", "Weekend Batch").

⏱️ 3. Period Management
PU College:

Default: 3 periods/day.

Add/edit/delete periods.

Set start & end times (e.g., 9:00–10:00 AM).

Post-PUC (3rd–7th Years):

Years 3–5: 7 periods/day (default).

Years 6–7: 8 periods/day (default).

Period customization: Add/delete periods, adjust timings.

📋 4. Attendance Management
All students marked "Present" by default.

Teachers mark "Absent" per period using toggles or checkboxes.

Leave Integration:

Teachers apply leave for students (From–To date, Reason).

System auto-detects absence after leave expiry and shows alerts.

🕌 5. Namaz Tracking
One-click bulk absent marking for namaz non-participants.

Generate Namaz attendance reports by class/year.

📄 6. Result Upload (PDF)
Teachers upload PDFs by:

Course (e.g., 2nd PU Science)

Batch (e.g., 1st PU Commerce Batch A)

Students do not access results; only teachers/principals can upload/manage PDFs.

🗨️ 7. Remarks Section
Teachers add remarks per student with description (e.g., "Needs improvement in Tajweed").

Teacher's name is auto-tagged.

Principals and Teachers can filter remarks by student or batch.

📝 8. Leave Management
Teachers apply student leave (From–To date, Reason).

System triggers post-leave absence alerts if student continues to miss periods.

📆 9. College Calendar (Principal Only)
