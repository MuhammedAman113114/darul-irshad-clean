I am building an attendance app in Replit using Node.js and Replit DB. I want to generate an Excel export file in the exact structure shown below, using the `xlsx` package.

📌 Expected Output: Timetable-wise Excel Format

🗂 Excel File:
- File name: Attendance_2ndPUC_Science_Jan2025.xlsx
- One sheet per subject (e.g., Maths, Physics, Chemistry, English, etc.)
- One final Summary sheet.

📝 Each Subject Sheet Format (like “Mathematics”):
- Columns:
  - Student Name
  - Roll No
  - All relevant [Day-Date-Period] headers (e.g., "Mon-02 P1", "Mon-02 P4", "Tue-03 P2")
  - Total Present
  - Total Classes
  - % (attendance percentage)
- Rows:
  - Each student
  - Attendance marked as “P” (present), “A” (absent), “-” (no class that period)

🧾 Summary Sheet Format:
- Columns:
  - Student Name
  - Roll No
  - One column for each subject with % attendance
  - Overall % (average of subject %)
  - Status (Excellent, Good, Below Avg based on thresholds)

📚 My DB Structure:
- Students: List of students with name and roll number
- Attendance: attendance[roll][date][period] = "P" / "A"
- Timetable: timetable[date][period] = subjectCode
- Subject Map: subjectCode → subjectName

🔁 Logic:
- For each subject:
  - Find all [date, period] slots where that subject was scheduled (from the timetable)
  - Check each student’s attendance for those slots
  - Count total conducted classes and number of “P” per student
  - Calculate subject-wise % for each student
- Summary:
  - Combine % from all subject sheets
  - Compute overall average %
  - Set status:
    - Excellent: ≥90%
    - Good: 75%–89%
    - Below Avg: <75%

📦 Use `xlsx` npm package to create this Excel file with proper sheet names and formatting.

✅ Export function should be triggered on a button click in my app and save the file as a downloadable Excel (.xlsx).

🛑 DO NOT dump raw period data or student-wise full attendance — only organize into the exact timetable-wise per-subject format like the example shown.
