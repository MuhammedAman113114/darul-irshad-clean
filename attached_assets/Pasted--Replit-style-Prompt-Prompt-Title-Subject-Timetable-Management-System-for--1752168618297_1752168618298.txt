💡 **Replit-style Prompt**

---

📌 **Prompt Title:** Subject & Timetable Management System for PUC & Post-PUC (Mobile-First UI)

🧹 **Project Type:** React Native (or Expo) + Replit DB

---

🔧 **Core Features to Build:**

### 🏛️ Institution Levels:

#### PUC:

* **Streams:** Commerce (with A & B Sections), Science (no sections)
* **Default Periods:** 3 periods/day

#### Post-PUC:

* **Years:** 3rd to 7th Year (no sections)
* **Period Configuration:**

  * 3rd–5th Year: 7 periods/day
  * 6th–7th Year: 8 periods/day

---

### 🖊️ Subject Management Section:

* Add subject name, subject code, year, course, stream, section (if any)
* UI: Simple list or table view with add/edit/delete
* Each stream/class should have independent subject lists

---

### ⏰ Timetable Builder Section (Mobile-First):

* Editable grid/table for weekly timetable
* **Columns:** Monday to Sunday

  * **Friday = weekly holiday (disabled)**
  * **Sunday = active working day**
* **Rows:** Auto-generate based on period config for selected year
* Allow admin to:

  * Set period name
  * Choose subject from subject list
  * Define time slot (start - end time)
* Responsive layout: Card UI or swipeable rows for mobile view

---

### 🔧 UX:

* Toggle edit/save mode
* Periods must match subject list
* Disable Friday globally ("Friday is weekly holiday")
* On year/stream selection, auto-fill default period count
* Add/remove periods dynamically (sync with other modules)

---

### 🔄 Integration & Sync (Bi-directional):

* Sync with:

  * ✅ Take Attendance
  * 📊 History
  * 🕒 Missed Attendance
* Auto-fetch period/subject per day per class for Attendance
* Class attendance pulls period data from timetable builder

---

### 📱 Mobile UX Considerations:

* Sticky top nav: Take Attendance | History | Sheet | Missed | Subject & Timetable
* Swipeable or collapsible period blocks
* Section dropdown for PUC Commerce
* Tooltip for Friday or validation errors
* Minimal scrolling, collapsible views

---

### ➕ Optional Enhancements:

* Export timetable as PDF
* Clone previous week's timetable as template

---

### 📊 Replit DB Structure Suggestion:

```json
/subjects:{year_stream_section} => [ { name, code } ]
/timetable:{year_stream_section} => {
  "Monday": [ { periodName, subjectName, startTime, endTime }, ... ],
  "Tuesday": [...],
  "Friday": "HOLIDAY",  // Disabled in UI and attendance
  "Sunday": [...]
}
/attendance:{date}:{classId} => [ { periodName, status, studentId }, ... ]
```

---

### ✅ Constraints:

* Friday = Weekly Holiday (no classes)
* Sunday = Active day (attendance + timetable allowed)
* Timetable period validation:

  * Subject must exist
  * No overlapping time
* Commerce only = Section A/B (PUC only)

---

### 🔗 Final Note:

Ensure all timetable/subject data automatically impacts:

* Attendance
* History
* Missed logs
* Design clean schema for future extensions (exams, substitutions)

Let me know if you want this exported as `.txt` or added into Replit directly.
